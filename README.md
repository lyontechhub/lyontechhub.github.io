Developers
----------
This web site is done with plain HTML/CSS3/Javascript and AngularJS.

The website is hosted through GitHub pages at lyontechhub.github.io as Organization pages (cf. https://help.github.com/articles/user-organization-and-project-pages).
Note that GitHub uses master branch to deploy, that's why we have 'dev' branch as the default one, which contains source code, that is compiled through Gulp and pushed to master for deployment (see below).

### Source code

It is built upon Bootstrap, with LESS files for theme customisation (see Dev & build environment).

AngularJS is used to organize code in views sharing a common layout and to adapt content according request result on JSON files stores in data directory.

Index.html file is the main entry point that define AngularJS application. Each view is then stored in views directory.

### JSON data & images

The following JSON files are used to provide content to dynamic views in 'data' directory:

* communities.json
* communities/[one per community].json

Images like community icons are in 'imgs' directory.

### Dev & build environment

Packages are managed through NPM and Bower. So you need NodeJS but just for NPM.

After cloning, just type the following commands to have a running web server:

```
npm install
npm start
```

Nb: `npm start` is configured to start a local Node web server

Gulp is used to build assets (CSS & JS) and copy other assets (data & images) used by the site.

* 'build' task is used to build JS, CSS (from LESS) and HTML to 'dist' directory ('npm start' launch 'build' task before running the local Node web server)
* 'watch' task is used to watch changes on source JS, LESS, HTML & assets files to trigger a build dynamically (never ending task)
* _NO MORE USED_ 'deploy' task is used to commit 'dist' directory content to 'master' branch (excluding 'data' & 'imgs' directories which are modified on 'master' branch directly), specify '--push' to effectively deploy on GitHub pages (i.e push on GitHub master branch)

If you want to be able to run the server and watch the files simultaneously you need to use:

```
npm run dev
```

### SEO compliance

To be SEO compliant, we embed the web site in a Node.js application only to use prerender.io. The application loads the Node.js module for prerender.io, called the middleware (see server.js file).
It uses Google AJAX crawling specification to make AngularJS application search engine compliant. See https://prerender.io/.

We use a heroku application for the prerender service, which crawl the web site with PhantomJS to return full old HTML. Prerender service is at http://mighty-waters-2486.herokuapp.com/.
It has been deployed with following instructions : https://github.com/prerender/prerender#deploying-your-own-on-heroku.
It has whitelist enabled with Lyon Tech Hub url only (config var : heroku config to list & heroku config:set to set).

### Deployment

We use heroku to host the web site. To deploy, just push dev branch to master branch of heroku git repository :

```
heroku git:remote -a lyontechhub #only the first time to add the heroku remote
git push heroku dev:master 
```

Continuous deployment use Heroku GitHub integration (was using heroku-deployer...no more now).
